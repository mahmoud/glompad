# TODO

# Tasks

* Select and translate examples
* Message on copy success

# Features

* fetch() target
* auto-run on change
* multiple targets/results (tabbed)

## Technical improvements

* Unplugin plugin for autogenerating the examples (currently in glomp.py)
* Unplugin plugin for transcluding the python (currently in glomp.py build)
* iframe-ability for glom docs?
* Version filter on examples (or colocate examples with glom itself)

# Ideas

* Error visualization (overlaid on target/spec?)
* Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced icons on examples?
* Enable more python execution in spec field (setup panel?)
* panel for generated glom code
